# Insurance-Charge-Prediction-using-Linear-Regression
In this case study, I embark on a journey to create a predictive model for insurance charges using the powerful tool of Linear Regression. The study begins with a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), where I delve into the dataset's attributes, distributions, and relationships. Visualizations are skillfully crafted to unveil patterns and insights that pave the way for a robust model.Before delving into model construction, I meticulously explore the concept of Variable Inflation Factor (VIF). By assessing multicollinearity among predictor variables, I ensure the model's accuracy and reliability by eliminating potential issues stemming from correlated features.The focal point of the case study is the development of a Linear Regression model. By leveraging the insights I garnered from EDA and VIF analysis, I craft a model that accurately predicts insurance charges based on a combination of influential attributes. The study highlights the significance of understanding feature importance and selecting appropriate predictors to achieve optimal predictive performance.
